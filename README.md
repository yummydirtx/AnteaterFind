This is a search engine project for IN4MATX 141/COMPSCI 121

As of currently (M2) to run this project you must run two things on two different terminals.
First run "search_server.py" in one terminal.


To launch the front end type 'cd search-frontend' in your second terminal
then install 'npm install' (if you don't have it already)

Once it is installed type 'npm start'
this will prompt the localhost on your browser

AnteaterFind should pop up and you can begin searching!
